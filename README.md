## ViewMate

ViewMate is a lightweight and efficient file viewer that supports multiple file formats, including TXT, LRC, CSV, and DAT.

## Features

**- TXT Support:** Reads and displays plain text files line by line.

**- LRC Support:** Loads and prints LRC (lyrics) files with proper encoding.

**- CSV Support:** Parses and displays CSV files in a structured format.

**- DAT Support:** Tries to unpickle data; if unsuccessful, reads as raw binary and attempts decoding.
